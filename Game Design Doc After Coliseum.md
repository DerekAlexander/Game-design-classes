# Game Overview
## High Concept
Life after death isn’t always so peaceful, especially when you wake up as a mechanized animal in a coliseum. Fight for your after life before The Rust consumes you…. Or get blown up by a tiger with a rocket launcher on its back.
## Description
Our game, After Coliseum is unique to its MOBA genre because of a few mechanics such as having a third person perspective, controller support, easier entry for a casual player, playable lobby area, character customization more in-depth than just skins. All of which of these are either new to the moba genre or rarely done well. Other key points of our game is a cartoon character art style with a heavy steam punk theme for the environment.

## Competitive Analysis
### Smite –Derek Alexander  
o	Smite would be a very close competition because some elements that make our game unique smite also has. Such as the third person perspective in a moba game. This kind of perspective in the moba genre adds a new level of game play like making the players learn to have a heightened map awareness and that dodging is a very viable option. But while smite is similar in this sense something that will set our game apart from it is the approachability it will have for a more casual audience. Another thing that will grab a different audience than smite is the art style. Smite has a very realistic feel to its art style. While our game will have a bit of a silly crazy art style, with a bit of steam punk thrown in for good measure.  

### League of Legends- Chris Delgado  
o	League of Legends is an insanely popular action MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.) As of January 2014, LoL reports that over 67 million play per month, 27 million per day and over 7.5 million concurrently during peak hours. In League of Legends, players control an avatar, also known as a “champion” with various unique abilities. Throughout a match these “champions” will grow in power, unlocking new abilities to unleash on their foes. Each match in League of Legends is pretty discrete. All Champions start off fairly weak and grow in power by accumulating gold and experience. League of Legends has a massive and extremely competitive fan base. In North America and Europe, Riot Games organizes the League of Legends Championship Series, which consists of 8 professional teams in each continent. Similar regional competitions exist in China, Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. These regional competitions culminate with the annual League of Legends World Championships, which in 2013 had a grand prize of $1 million and attracted 32 million viewers online.  

### Dawngate- joe  
o	Dawngate is a new moba that will compete with our game because of the elements it implements in the game. Dawngate has both different classes of characters, customization, and the ability to change the stats of a character based on what spells and items the player chooses. Our game similarly has customization that allows the player to adapt their character to how they want to play the game by adding/subtracting different armors, abilities, and weapons from their character along with having three different classes of character light, standard, and tank, which also offer a different way to deal with enemies. What sets our game apart from Dawngate though is that the roles aren’t set in stone for the characters in our game a player can start out as a tank and through the customization create a character that’s got more speed than a standard tank, a light character can be equipped with weapons and armor in order to better protect itself, and the standard character can become a light or heavy character based on what its equipped with. In this way our game shines as Dawngate has four classes with specific uses its customization only allows for some base stats to be changed, but does not give the character a significant change in game play style as a result.

Both games have their up-points, but After Coliseum is in a different ballpark when compared to the mass online multiplayer known as WoW. While they each share similar points, After Coliseum takes the cake when it comes to having a fresh appearance. To be fair though, each title is hard to compare since they are, by their own right, different genres. What makes After Coliseum stand out however is its wide variety of skins and upgrades along with the handy feature of being able to use another console’s controller in order to play. Also, penguins with Jet Packs. Enough said.
